Whenever we hit a url say: https://www.youtube.com
request is sent from my browser --> youtube web-server --> you get the youtube dynamic page --> refresh --> different response (which show each time new request is sent(same happens even in case of static))




➤ Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level 
protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia 
information systems.

➤ HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used 
to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on 
the World Wide Web. 

➤ HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be 
constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers 
respond to these requests.

Basic Features 
➤ HTTP is connectionless: HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP 
request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response.
 
➤ The server processes the request and sends a response back after which 
client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each 
other during current request and response only. Further requests are made 
on new connection like client and server are new to each other. 

➤ HTTP is media independent: Any type of data can be sent by HTTP as 
long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content.

➤ HTTP is stateless: HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP 
being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only 
during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. 
Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can 
retain information between different requests across the web pages
