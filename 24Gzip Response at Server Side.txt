nginx -s reload

now go to browser and check the network tab,you will see transmitted is lower than resource


now if we curl this through cli and not the browser we will see that we won't get configuraton for compression layed out.(as broswer handles the headers)
curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" -I http://ip/assets/js/jquery.js

➤ How fast a website will load depends on the size of all of the 
files that have to be downloaded by the browser. 

➤ Reducing the size of files to be transmitted can make the 
website not only load faster, but also cheaper to those who 
have to pay for their bandwidth usage. 

➤ Response files can be minimise by configure Nginx to use gzip 
to compress files it serves on the fly. 

➤ Compressing files use up server resources, so it is best to 
compress only those files that will reduce its size considerably 
in result
