<?php phpinfo(); ?>

save this file


nginx -t

nginx -s reload

502 bad gateway! It is not 404 so resource is available, nginx and php process is not able to communicate.


check tail -10f /var/log/nginx/error.log


do
 ps -aux | grep nginx
 root        nginx: master process usr/bin/nginx
 nobody      nginx: worker process                  ---> here is the problem nobody user is allowed for worker process

do
 ps -aux | php
 root         php-fpm:  master process
 www-data     php-fpm: pool www
 www-data     php-fpm: pool www

nginx.conf


user www-data; <-- added this

events {
}

http { 
        
    include mine.types;
 
    server{
      
       listen 8081;
       server_name ip_address/domain;
      
       root /bloggingtemplate/;
 
       index index.php index.html;       <-------- whenever you are working with static/dynamic content(index is a directive), index.php for dynamic, index.html(present at root) for static
     
       location / {
               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
       
       location ~\.php$ {                <---------- for all the files which have .php extension, TO WORK WITH php we need dynamic process handling for which we need THE php we need fastcgi module.

       }
}
}

ps -ef | nginx ---> this time it will show www-data user for worker process
nginx -s reload

now go to browser and do: ip/info.php

IT WORKS!!


now again cd /bloggingtemplate/

vi index.php

<?php
echo "Hello!<br>";
echo "Welcome to NGINX Training<br>";
echp "Enjoy all of thr NGINX Lectures<br>"
?>

save

now if you go to just ip/ you will get this php file as it is set first and index.html later.

ip/index.html will give you html file.
